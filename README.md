# LPBoost-Using-String-and-Fisher-Features
LPBoost with string and Fisher features

Current implemented:
Generate string features with formatted sequence files.
LPBoost (not dynamic) using string features.

To be implemented:
Recent--
Generate Fisher features with formatted sequence files.
Create feature matrix of Fisher features if n_transition==1. This is to decrease the computational time.
Future--
LPBoost (dynamic) using string/ Fisher features.
Generated feature matrix using (to some extent) unformatted sequence files.
